# Pol-NAS: A Neural Architecture Search Method with Feature Selection for PolSAR Image Classification

Here we provide the code of Pol-NAS in "The code of Pol-NAS.zip" and the complete results of feature visualization of each model in "The complete results of feature visualization in Pol-NAS.pdf". We have uploaded them to this repository. You can download them.

## Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Python 3.8.0
- CUDA 11.2 (lower versions may work but were not tested)
- One NVIDIA 3090 GPU
